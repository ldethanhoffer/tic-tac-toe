As part of the [Iskills](https://www.ischool.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Winter-2020-iSkills-posters.pdf) introduction to programming for librarians @ the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca), you'll be adapting code to run a game of Tic-Tac-Toe


Here is the final solution implemented as a class in Python!  

To play the game simply run the [tictactoe.py](https://github.com/ldethanhoffer/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/tictactoe.py) script...

If you'd like a little more insight on how the module works, just follow along the project with the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ldethanhoffer/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/tictactoe.ipynb)...  

Enjoy!
