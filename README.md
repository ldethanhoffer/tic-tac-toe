A simple game of tic-tac-toe implemented as a class in python!  

To play the game simply run the [tictactoe.py](https://github.com/ldethanhoffer/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/tictactoe.py) script...

If you'd like a little more insight on how the module works, just follow along the project with the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/ldethanhoffer/tic-tac-toe/blob/master/tictactoe.ipynb)...  

Enjoy!
